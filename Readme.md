# **Want to upgrade your traditional networking infrastructure?**

Network is vigorous and requires updates in operation mode. Several confusions and problems can be caused due to careless schedule in the update process. The problem was in limelight for a very long time until Software Defined Networking (SDN) brings new opportunities and solutions by the separation of control and data plane, as well as centralized control. It is a perception that has the potential to change the networks and the way they are designed and operated.

In recent years, software-defined networking ([SDN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-uYrlFnRVY)) has emerged as the next big thing in the networking industry. Given all the hype, where are we now?

Traditional networking uses integrated hardware and software to direct traffic across the series of routers and switches. The original use case of SDN was to visualize the network by separating the control plane that manages the network from the data plane, where the traffic flows. A smart controller is running specialized software that manages all network traffic in the data centers, and a series of routers and switches that forward packets of traffic.

## *Virtualizing the network comes with advantages:*

* Networks can be spun up and down dynamically.

*  They can be perfectly tuned for specific application use cases.

* On each individual network, security policies can be installed.

Today, the SDN market is evolving, and it’s breaking out of the data center. SDN is used in the Wide Area Network to control how enterprises connect to their branch offices. SD-WAN uses software to cluster multiple types of network connections such as broadband, MPLS, or wireless to create strong and cost-effective connections.

*Microsegmentation*is the idea of using SDN for security purposes. Some networks can be ultra-secure and carry sensitive data. Other networks can be public-facing. So, if a hacker gets into a public-facing web server, they are restricted to the server segment of the network. This limits the hacker’s ability to access any other segments, such as secure data centers networks.

SDN is also used in an area called Network Function Virtualization ([NFV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl5UJUR1uV4)). This is the idea of replacing specialized hardware like firewalls load balancers with software running on off-the-shelf server hardware.

Even though there is a direct relationship between SDN and NFV, they are not dependent on each other. Many service providers go beyond simply providing network connectivity for their enterprise customers. They also offer additional services and network functions like network address translations, firewalls, encryptions, Domain Name Service, and others. These networks are installed using constructional hardware at the customers surrounding. This approach provides additional revenue. But deploying multiple preparatory devices is costly and makes-up for its difficult. Every time a new network function is added to a service. A truck roller is required to install the dedicated hardware.

Service providers began exploring ways to reduce costs and accelerate the limits through NFV. NFV decouples functions like a firewall or encryption from dedicated hardware, and move the functions to virtual servers. Rather than installing the expensive constructional hardware, service providers can purchase inexpensive switches, storage, and servers to run virtual machines that perform network functions. This collapses multiple functions into a simple physical server, reducing cost and minimizing truck rolls.

If a customer needs to add a new network function, the service provider can simply spin up a new virtual machine to perform that function. NFV refers to the strategy of virtualizing network functions, moving from separate preparatory pieces of hardware to software on several virtual servers using standard hardware. Along with it, we have orchestration capabilities, data repositories, automation layers, and management environments too.

With the explanation, are you confused about which one to use (SDN or NFV)?

First of all, you don’t need to have both SDN and NFV to accomplish a use-case. As mentioned above, these are not dependent technologies. You can just have an NFV platform or just SDN.

*When to use SDN?* – If you have a complex or shattered network ecosystem that spans multiple data centers, it makes sense for you to abstract that control layer and involve SDN. So that you can control network functionality, traffic distribution, and also the network automation.

*When to have NFV?* – When it comes to NFV, let’s assume that already you have a compatible networking environment. But you need to monitor, and control specific services within your data center. Here, it’s better to deploy a virtual device that acts as a healthy load-balancer keeping an eye on workloads in your data center, the cloud, and in between. Similarly, it can deploy a virtual security service that monitors the traffic hitting a particular application. These are examples of deploying NFVs to reduce cost and physical infrastructure by the utilization of virtualization technologies.

### *Let’s see how the upgraded networks (with SDV and NFV) overcome the traditional networks and how it boosts the business:*

* *Cost-effective*: Upgraded networks will help to reduce the cost in purchasing network equipment (hardware) via migration to software on standard servers, thereby reduces the truck rolls too.

* *Compatible*: It’s more efficient in space consumption, with more efficiency in power consumption, and cooling ability.

*	*Flexibility*: Upgraded networks are more flexible, allowing the users great control and ease for managing the resources virtually.

*	*Better communication*: Unlike traditional switches, upgraded networks can communicate better. It allows the users to use the software, to provision new devices instead of physical infrastructure.

*	*Security*: Virtual machines constitute a challenge for firewalls and content filtering. It diminishes the chance of hacking.

#### *Challenges related to SDN and NFV*

*	Limitation in legacy infrastructure: NFV is deployed to reduce the cost and operating expenses by enabling administrators to spend less time managing data centers. But it’s found it difficult to adopt this facility in legacy networks. Several old products cannot be updated to support NFV technology.

*	Lag in standardization: Another big challenge is the need for a standard for communication among NFV components. Even though developing a standard for this technology takes several years, the European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) is all set to develop it.

*	Difficulty in accommodating rapid on-demand growth: The adequate increase in demand for new computing, network, and storage in software-defined network infrastructure produces high risk in monitoring platforms. These should be able to add additional monitoring capacities. Otherwise, it leads to visibility gapping.
